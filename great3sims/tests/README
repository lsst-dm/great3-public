README for galaxy generation yaml tests
April 20, 2015

This directory contains some simple test scripts which can generate galaxy images
from either parameterized or real_galaxies convolved with Psfs supplied from fits
files.  Currently, these tests use the real_galaxy data from the COSMOS 23.5 
training set, though we intend to exchange these for PhoSim and HSC Psf images
as soon as possible.

1. Untar COSMOS_23.5_training_sample.tar.gz and great3_galaxy_selection_files.tar.gz.
   This is the "gals" directory which must be passed to great3sims.run.
   I have these in a directory at the same level as great3-public, named
   COSMOS_23.5_training_sample.

To use parameterized galaxies:

2. Run the program 'python control.py'

3. Run 'galsim cgc.yaml'.

4. The results are place in tests/control/ground/constant.

To run the real_galaxy test,

2. Run the program 'python real_galaxy.py' for parameterized galaxies.

3. Run 'galsim rgc.yaml'.

4. The results are place in tests/real_galaxy/ground/constant.

control.py and real_galaxy.py set values from control.py which allow short, test runs to be done
Note that the max_subfield parameter must be set on the input to great3sims.run() because of a bug.
Using the default constants.py creates a very long run.  If you are just doing a trial,
the sample scripts here overide the defaults so that only one image is produced.
